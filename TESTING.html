<h1>Kwun Tong Maryknoll College</h1>
<br>
<p>Kwun Tong Maryknoll College (Chinese: 觀塘瑪利諾書院; KTMC) is a Catholic boys' secondary school in Hong Kong. It was established in 1971 by the Maryknoll Fathers, a society of Catholic priests and brothers founded in the United States in 1911. The college's anniversary day is the first Friday in May.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Foundation</h3>
<p>In the late 1950s, the Maryknoll Fathers had begun working in the Kwun Tong area. In 1962, the Maryknoll Father Society asked the Education Department for assistance in building a subsidised Anglo-Chinese secondary school in Kwun Tong.The planning of the school was delayed by the unrest of the late 1960s and the serious inflation which upset all cost estimates.Groundbreaking occurred in the summer of 1971 and the construction of the school building began.The school was founded finally in 1971.</p>
<p>Before completion of the school campus, students had to use the classrooms at Sing Yin Secondary School for lessons. Unfortunately, the opening of the new school building was delayed for three weeks due to the Sau Mau Ping landslide on 18 June 1972, but students were able to take possession of the new building on 25 September 1972.</p>
<h3>School emblem</h3>
<p>The emblem of Kwun Tong Maryknoll College was designed by its first supervisor, Rev. John Cioppa, M.M., using the symbol of the Maryknoll Father Society – the "Chi-Rho". There are two Greek letters: Chi written as "X" and Rho written as "P". These are the first two letters of the Greek word for Christ (χριστός). The round figure, or oval, is said to represent the globe or world for whom Christ came as Saviour. Thus, the emblem intends to show the school's unity with the work of the Maryknoll Fathers in many countries throughout the world, the work of bringing Christ's love to all people and races.<p>
